# BlockChain in Rust

This repository holds my expirements tinkering with creating a block chain using Rust.


### Setup
```cargo run```

will create the executable.

Runs a local web server on port 3000 that will respond to GET/POST requests 

to add a coin send a POST request to localhost:3000/ with body {"bpm":10} 
to see the chain send a GET request to localhost:3000/

### Todo
Networking between nodes has not been implemented yet.
